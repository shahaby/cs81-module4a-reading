# REFLECTION

**What was the most helpful aspect of this codeâ€™s structure?**  
The code is modular with isolated functions for each specific task, which makes it easy to understand, edit and improve.

**What part was confusing or took longer to understand?**  
At first glance the fact that the code was broken down to so many small pieces was confusing but it is a good habit for much more complex projects.
